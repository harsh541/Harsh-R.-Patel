1) If this pivot searching was available to me I could see myself applying this whenever I forgot or wanted to track my progress on the computer. I think most of the search would go unused since I don't worry about forgeting stuff on the internet, I could see this type of software being very handy for law! For example we may finally find out if Hilary Clinton actually deleted her emails or not, maybe this software can help us in other ways to benefit society.
